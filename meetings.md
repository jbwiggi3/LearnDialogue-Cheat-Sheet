## High-level idea
Each week we try to have at least one meeting with Dr. Boyer and update her on our current research status. This is an opportunity to get feedback and guidance on research tasks.
Below is a list of items that will be helpful in planning your meeting. It is protocol to make an agenda containing these items, which you share with her before meeting and serve as a weekly research journal.

### LearnDialogue 25 Minute Meeting Template:

1. Review research open loops
 * List all current commitments (large tasks that will take a week or more to complete)
2. Report which loops received your attention in the past week and why
3. Report and get feedback on what you did in the past week
4. Describe and get feedback on your plan for the coming week
5. Schedule any necessary follow-up meetings and mention hold-ups
